üõ†Ô∏è Project Title: Auto Tagging Support Tickets Using BERT (LLM-based Classifier)
üìå Overview
This project implements a powerful LLM-based classification system using a fine-tuned BERT model to automatically tag IT support tickets. It addresses the common challenge faced by technical support teams‚Äîmanual triaging and categorization of incoming support requests.

By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transformer-based language modeling, the system understands the semantics of each ticket and assigns it the most appropriate label from a predefined set (e.g., Software Bug, Network Issue, Account Access, etc.). This enables faster ticket resolution, better routing, and optimized workload distribution.

üéØ Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Automate the classification of support tickets.

Reduce manual tagging effort.

Improve ticket handling speed and accuracy.

Visualize predictions with clear, user-friendly outputs.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
Fine-Tuned BERT Model: Utilizes the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture, fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of support tickets for high-accuracy classification.

Multi-Class Prediction: Supports multiple categories relevant to IT support workflows.

Softmax-based Confidence Scoring: Outputs probabilities for top predictions.

Top-K Visualization: Displays the top predicted tags along with their respective confidence scores.

Color-Coded Outputs: Enhances interpretability by assigning distinct colors to different tags for visual clarity.

Gradio Interface (optional): Provides a clean and interactive UI for testing the model on sample inputs.

üß† How It Works
Input: A raw IT support ticket in text form.

Preprocessing: The text is tokenized using a Hugging Face BERT tokenizer with attention masking and padding.

Model Inference: The processed input is passed through the fine-tuned BERT model.

Prediction: The model outputs logits which are passed through softmax to get probability scores for each class.

Tag Assignment: The label with the highest probability is selected as the predicted tag. Optionally, top-K predictions are shown.

Visualization: A horizontal bar chart is generated with each predicted tag and its confidence score, colored distinctly.

üìä Dataset Used
Source: Kaggle ‚Äì IT Support Ticket Data

Description: The dataset contains a collection of anonymized support ticket texts along with their corresponding labels, such as hardware failure, login issues, connectivity problems, and more.

üß™ Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated on a test split using:

Accuracy

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

These metrics ensured that the model not only predicts the correct label but does so with confidence and consistency across all classes.

üñºÔ∏è Sample Output
When a user enters a ticket like:

‚ÄúI can't connect to the company VPN from home.‚Äù

The model might return:

Tag	Confidence
Network Issue	85%
Connectivity	10%
Software Bug	5%

The result is also visualized as a color-coded bar graph.

üîç Use Cases

Chatbot Routing Enhancements

Enterprise Workflow Optimization

üí° Future Work
Incorporating multi-label classification for overlapping issues.

Expanding to multilingual support tickets.

Integration with ticketing platforms like Zendesk, Jira, or Freshdesk.

Real-time tagging in customer-facing applications.

üß∞ Technologies Used
Python

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib / Plotly (for visualization)

Gradio (for interactive demos)

üöÄ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how large language models like BERT can significantly improve support workflows by automating ticket classification. With high accuracy and interpretable visual outputs, it reduces the burden on support staff, speeds up resolution times, and enhances customer satisfaction.
